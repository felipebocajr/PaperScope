However, existing editing methods face a critical tradeoff: they either successfully apply edits but silently degrade the model's general capabilities, or they preserve capabilities at the cost of weak edits. This capability degradation resembles \"reward hacking\"—appearing to succeed while corrupting broader functionality like reasoning, instruction-following, and fluency.\n\n## The Approach\n\nCrispEdit formulates model editing as a constrained optimization problem: minimize edit loss while keeping capability loss below a specified threshold. The core insight is that not all parameter directions equally affect model capabilities. By analyzing the loss landscape curvature (characterized by the Gauss-Newton Hessian), CrispEdit identifies \"low-curvature\" directions—parameter changes that leave capabilities nearly invariant. The method:\n\n1. Uses **Bregman divergence** to measure capability preservation, enabling reliable curvature estimates even when models aren't fully trained\n2. Applies **K-FAC (Kronecker-factored approximate curvature)** to make Hessian computation tractable for billion-parameter models\n3. Introduces **matrix-free projections** that exploit Kronecker structure to avoid constructing prohibitively large projection matrices\n4. Supports both batch editing (many edits simultaneously) and sequential editing (edits arriving over time)\n\n## Main Contributions and Results\n\n- **Theoretical insight**: Proves that popular heuristic methods like AlphaEdit solve a significantly more restrictive special case of CrispEdit's framework\n- **Empirical performance**: Achieves ~80% edit success on LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct while maintaining base capabilities nearly intact (<1% degradation on average)\n- **Scalability**: Processes 3,000 edits in 4 minutes (compared to hours for competing methods) and scales to 10,000 edits\n- **Robustness**: Works effectively with minimal capability data (as few as 100 samples) and generalizes across model architectures\n- **Realistic evaluation**: Tests under autoregressive decoding rather than unrealistic teacher-forced evaluation, revealing that prior methods actually degrade capabilities substantially\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nModel editing is critical for keeping deployed LLMs current and safe, but current methods create an unacceptable tradeoff. CrispEdit solves this by providing a principled, theoretically grounded approach that achieves strong edits without degrading general capabilities—all while remaining computationally efficient. This enables practical deployment of editing in production systems where models must be continuously updated while maintaining reliability across diverse tasks.",

This is puzzling because current safety theory suggests that in high-dimensional parameter spaces, unrelated fine-tuning updates should be nearly orthogonal to safety-critical directions and thus benign. Yet this degradation happens consistently and unpredictably across different tasks and models. The paper identifies this as \"the paradox of high-dimensional orthogonality.\"\n\n## The Approach\n\nThe authors develop a geometric theory grounded in the curvature of parameter-space trajectories during gradient descent. Rather than treating safety as residing in static directions (which would be orthogonal to most random updates), they show that alignment concentrates in low-dimensional subspaces with *sharp curvature*. While initial fine-tuning updates may indeed be orthogonal to these subspaces, the curvature of the fine-tuning loss landscape causes second-order acceleration that systematically bends trajectories into alignment-sensitive regions—an effect invisible to first-order analysis.\n\nThey formalize this through the **Alignment Instability Condition (AIC)**, which identifies three structural properties: low-rank sensitivity (alignment is fragile in few directions), initial orthogonality (early updates avoid these directions), and curvature coupling (the fine-tuning objective curves the trajectory into sensitive regions).\n\n## Main Contributions\n\n**Theorems:** The authors prove that:\n- **Theorem 6.1:** Movement into alignment-sensitive subspaces incurs quadratic utility loss proportional to the curvature\n- **Theorem 6.2:** Under the AIC, projection into sensitive directions grows *quadratically* over time due to second-order acceleration\n- **Corollary 6.3:** These combine to yield a **quartic scaling law**—alignment degradation grows as the fourth power of training time\n\nThis explains why safety failures appear sudden in practice: small curvature coupling compounds dramatically through the fourth-power relationship.\n\n**Experiments:** They empirically validate that (1) Fisher Information Matrices exhibit the predicted low-rank structure, and (2) an \"Overlap Score\" measuring geometric coupling between fine-tuning updates and alignment-sensitive directions successfully predicts which tasks will cause safety degradation—without requiring adversarial data.\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nThis work exposes a **structural blind spot** in current safety practices. Dominant defenses (null-space projections, gradient filtering, first-order constraints) only address static snapshots of the problem, providing false reassurance while missing the fundamental dynamic mechanism of failure. The theory reveals that alignment fragility is not a bug to be patched but an intrinsic property of gradient descent on curved manifolds.\n\nThe results have practical implications: practitioners can now use geometric diagnostics to assess fine-tuning risk *before* training, identify warning signs *during* training, and understand *why* safety failures occur. More fundamentally, the work argues that safe fine-tuning requires **curvature-aware methods** that dynamically track evolving sensitive subspaces, suggesting a shift from reactive red-teaming to predictive geometric diagnostics for open-weight model deployment.",

While recent work has explored alternatives like linear attention and RNN-based architectures, few have been adapted for bidirectional, encoder-only settings. Extending existing models to longer sequences remains challenging under tight compute budgets.\n\n## The Approach\n\nThe authors reformulate Avey—a recent attention-free, autoregressive architecture—into Avey-B, a bidirectional encoder. The key innovations are: (1) **decoupled parameterization** that separates learned static weights from input-dependent cosine similarity scores across alternating layers, avoiding pathological behaviors where more relevant tokens contribute less; (2) **row-wise normalization** of similarity scores for training stability; and (3) a **neural compression module** that distills retrieved context back to original split size before processing, maintaining efficiency in bidirectional inference.\n\n## Main Contributions and Results\n\nAvey-B outperforms BERT and NeoBERT across all benchmarks and consistently surpasses RoBERTa and ModernBERT on token classification and information retrieval tasks—despite being pretrained on ~11× fewer tokens than ModernBERT. Most significantly, Avey-B achieves far superior scaling: with a power-law decay exponent of α≈0.44, it maintains throughput that declines ~half as fast as ModernBERT (α≈0.77) and NeoBERT (α≈0.81) as sequence length increases to 96K tokens, reaching 3.38× and 11.63× speedups respectively.\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nThis work demonstrates that attention is not the only viable path to effective bidirectional encoders. Avey-B's structural efficiency—rooted in processing fixed-size splits rather than full sequences—offers a practical solution for deploying encoders in production settings with long-context requirements and strict latency/memory constraints, while maintaining competitive accuracy across diverse NLP tasks.",

Current approaches require either repeated full retraining or simultaneous access to all datasets. Critically, in multi-hospital environments, the source dataset (task identity) is often unknown at inference time. This paper addresses continual learning for chest radiographs—updating models with sequential datasets while preserving previous performance and maintaining accurate task identification without explicit labels.\n\n## The Approach\n\nThe authors propose CARL-XRay, which uses a frozen high-capacity Swin Transformer backbone combined with lightweight, task-specific adapters and classifier heads. When a new dataset arrives, only the new adapter and head are trained while previous ones remain frozen, preventing catastrophic forgetting. A shared \"latent task selector\" network learns to identify which dataset a test image belongs to by operating on task-adapted features. Critically, the selector is stabilized through feature-level experience replay—storing compressed feature vectors (not raw images) from previous tasks. The framework also includes learnable task prototypes that help maintain consistent decision boundaries across updates.\n\n## Main Results\n\nCARL-XRay achieves strong performance on two large public datasets (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert):\n- Maintains diagnostic AUROC of 0.74-0.75 with minimal forgetting (0.012 drop)\n- Achieves 75% routing accuracy in task-unknown inference (versus only 62.5% for joint training)\n- Adds only 2.3 MB of parameters (0.08% overhead compared to the backbone)\n- Ablations show experience replay is essential—without it, routing accuracy drops to 14.3%\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nThis work addresses a genuine clinical need: healthcare systems need to incorporate new data over years without storing historical images or retraining from scratch. The finding that sequential training with task-specific modules outperforms joint training for task-unknown routing is practically significant, as real deployments cannot assume explicit task identifiers. By avoiding raw-image storage through feature-level replay, the approach aligns with clinical privacy and governance requirements.

      "summary": "# Summary: Validating LLM Simulations as Behavioral Evidence\n\n## The Problem\n\nResearchers increasingly use large language models (LLMs) as cheap substitutes for human participants in behavioral science studies. However, there is little consensus on when LLM-generated responses can be trusted as valid evidence about real human behavior. This creates a fundamental question: under what conditions can simulated data replace or supplement actual human data for scientific inference?\n\n## The Approach\n\nThe authors distinguish three strategies for using LLMs in behavioral research. The **heuristic approach** validates LLMs on a small set of human studies, then assumes they work similarly on new tasks—a \"validate-then-simulate\" method. The **simulate-then-validate approach** uses LLMs only for exploratory design testing before conducting human studies. The **statistical calibration approach** combines small human samples with larger LLM samples using formal statistical methods to correct for LLM bias.\n\n## Main Contributions and Results\n\nThe authors show that heuristic validation lacks guarantees of validity. For LLMs to substitute for human data without bias, two stringent conditions must hold: (1) no training data leakage—experimental scenarios must not appear in the model's training data—and (2) preservation of moment conditions—LLM errors cannot correlate with study variables in ways that distort parameter estimates. These conditions are rarely verifiable in practice.\n\nStatistical calibration offers a more principled alternative, combining human and LLM data through formal statistical adjustments that prevent bias when explicit assumptions hold. However, empirical results show only modest precision gains (13–14% effective sample size increases), limited by the inherent unpredictability of human behavior and current LLM prediction errors. The simulate-then-validate approach reduces risks but struggles with LLM tendency to overestimate effect sizes, particularly for small effects typical in social science.\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nThis work establishes rigorous epistemological standards for AI-assisted behavioral science. By clarifying when heuristic approaches fail to meet scientific standards and when statistical methods can provide valid inference, it prevents researchers from treating LLM simulations as valid ground truth without justification. The analysis also highlights underexplored opportunities—using LLMs for hypothesis generation, design analysis, mechanistic investigation through internal representations, and feature discovery—that may improve science beyond simple human substitution. This guidance is crucial as LLMs become increasingly prominent in research, helping ensure that efficiency gains do not come at the cost of scientific validity.",

However, evaluating the quality of moderation decisions presents a fundamental trade-off: expert reviewers produce highly trustworthy labels but are expensive and limited in capacity, while scalable automated systems are cost-effective but less reliable. This creates three critical challenges: decisions can silently degrade without monitoring, different labeling methods cannot be objectively compared, and content distributions constantly shift in production environments.\n\n## The Approach\n\nThe framework centers on a **Golden Dataset (GDS)**—a small, expertly-curated set of high-quality labels created by subject matter experts that serves as a stable ground truth benchmark. Rather than trying to estimate ground truth statistically from noisy labels, the GDS provides an explicit reference standard. The framework uses an automated, intelligent sampling pipeline with **propensity scores** to efficiently expand the GDS's coverage by prioritizing underrepresented content types. The system runs three interconnected workflows: a policy workflow that tracks policy versions, an update workflow that intelligently selects and labels new content, and a metrics workflow that continuously evaluates decision quality.\n\n## Main Contributions and Results\n\nThe framework introduces: (1) a systematic approach to dataset curation using inverse propensity sampling; (2) quantitative metrics for both dataset quality (semantic coverage and distributional divergence) and decision quality (accuracy, precision, recall, and inter-rater reliability); and (3) practical applications including benchmarking LLM versus human performance, systematic prompt optimization with measurable exit criteria, and monitoring for policy evolution impacts. Results demonstrate that LLMs perform on par with single human reviewers but lag expert quality, and the framework enables precise cost-performance trade-off analysis (e.g., showing when one model justifies higher costs than another).\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nThis framework transforms content moderation from subjective judgment into a data-driven science. It enables Pinterest to: continuously validate that enforcement quality hasn't degraded, optimize LLM behavior through rapid iteration with trustworthy feedback, manage complex policy changes rigorously, and maintain the integrity of critical platform-wide metrics. More broadly, it provides a blueprint for responsible AI deployment in safety-critical domains, allowing organizations to balance the competing demands of scale, cost, and trustworthiness in automated decision-making systems.",

However, these basic methods treat all categories as equally distant from each other and fail to capture meaningful relationships between related subtypes. For example, different types of walls or slabs have semantic similarities that traditional encoding ignores, limiting AI's ability to truly understand the nuanced distinctions in building information.\n\n## The Approach\n\nThe researchers propose using embeddings from large language models (LLMs) as encodings instead of conventional methods. LLM embeddings—such as those from OpenAI's GPT or Meta's LLaMA—capture semantic relationships learned from vast training datasets, allowing related building object subtypes to be represented as mathematically similar vectors. Rather than using traditional sigmoid functions, they modified the training process to use cosine embedding loss, which preserves semantic relationships in high-dimensional space. They also tested dimensionality reduction techniques (Matryoshka representation model) to compress these embeddings while retaining their semantic value.\n\n## Main Results\n\nExperiments on classifying 42 building object subtypes across five residential building models showed that LLM-based encodings outperformed traditional one-hot encoding. The best result—\"llama-3 (compacted)\"—achieved an F1-score of 0.8766 compared to 0.8475 for one-hot encoding. Importantly, compacted 1,024-dimensional embeddings performed better than original high-dimensional ones, suggesting that the compression process effectively removes noise while preserving essential semantic information.\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nThis work demonstrates a practical way to enhance AI's understanding of domain-specific terminology and relationships in the construction industry.

This creates a fundamental ambiguity: a single agent's local observation can correspond to many different possible global states (a one-to-many mapping problem). Existing approaches using discriminative models (like RNNs) fail by collapsing this ambiguity into a single point estimate, leading to mode collapse where they either average distinct plausible states into a nonsensical representation or arbitrarily pick one possibility while ignoring others.\n\n## The Approach\nRather than using discriminative models, the authors propose **GlobeDiff**, which uses **conditional diffusion models** for generative global state inference. The key insight is to introduce a latent variable *z* that acts as a \"mode selector\" to handle the one-to-many mapping. During training, a posterior network learns which latent *z* is needed to reconstruct the true global state from local observations and the true state. During inference, a prior network predicts *z* from only the local observations. The method then applies a reverse diffusion process (iterative denoising) to generate realistic global states conditioned on both local observations and the sampled latent variable.\n\n## Main Contributions and Results\n1. **Theoretical guarantees**: The paper proves that estimation error is bounded for both unimodal (Theorem 1) and multi-modal (Theorem 2) distributions, connecting error bounds to diffusion accuracy and latent variable alignment.\n\n2. **Empirical validation**: GlobeDiff significantly outperforms baselines (LBS, Dynamic Belief, CommFormer) on SMAC-v1 and SMAC-v2 benchmarks, with visual evidence (Voronoi polygon analysis) showing accurate state reconstruction that improves during training.\n\n3. **Generative advantage**: Compared to alternatives like VAEs and MLPs, GlobeDiff's diffusion-based approach better captures complex multi-modal distributions needed for accurate state inference.\n\n## Why It Matters\nPartial observability is fundamental to real-world multi-agent systems where agents cannot access global information. By enabling accurate inference of global states from limited local observations, GlobeDiff allows agents to make better coordinated decisions despite uncertainty. The work provides both theoretical rigor and practical improvements, integrating seamlessly with existing multi-agent RL frameworks.

These barriers are particularly acute in engineering domains with proprietary data and sensitive operations. This creates a critical bottleneck for AI development.\n\n## The Approach\nThe paper advocates using **simulation** to generate synthetic training data as a systematic and cost-effective alternative to real-world data collection. Rather than manually creating or equation-generating data, simulation combines systematic reproducibility with diversity by creating virtual models that mimic real-world systems and produce realistic behavioral traces. The authors survey multiple simulation methods—discrete-event simulation, agent-based simulation, system dynamics, computational fluid dynamics, Monte Carlo methods, and computer graphics-based simulation—each suited to different domains and system types.\n\n## Main Contributions and Results\nThe paper introduces the **DT4AI framework**, which integrates digital twins (high-fidelity virtual replicas of physical systems) into AI training workflows. The framework maps key interactions between AI agents, digital twins, and physical systems, supporting three main AI patterns: reinforcement learning (live, small-data queries), deep learning (batch, big-data queries), and transfer learning (sim-to-real adaptation). The work also comprehensively addresses the **sim-to-real gap**—the critical challenge where AI models trained in simulation fail in real-world deployment—and catalogs mitigation strategies including domain randomization, domain adaptation, meta-learning, robust reinforcement learning, and imitation learning.\n\n## Why It Matters\nAs AI increasingly powers real-world systems (robotics, autonomous vehicles, healthcare), simulation-based training offers safer, faster, and cheaper development. Digital twins enable closed-loop coupling between virtual and physical systems, allowing continuous model refinement.

This densifies the limited motion library into diverse long-horizon trajectories that vary by approach distance, stride phase, and timing.\n\n2. **Expert Training**: Skill-specific expert policies are trained with privileged information (full state access) to track the composed motion references using reinforcement learning.\n\n3. **Distillation with DAgger + RL**: Multiple experts are distilled into a single depth-based student policy using a hybrid objective combining behavioral cloning (DAgger) and PPO. Crucially, they augment DAgger with RL to provide success-driven feedback, correcting the conservative actions that pure imitation learning produces for explosive movements like climbing pulls.\n\n## Main Contributions and Results\n\n- **Motion matching for skill composition**: Generated diverse, transition-rich training data while preserving human motion elegance\n- **Scalable training framework**: Successfully distilled 20+ dynamic skills into one unified visuomotor policy\n- **Real-world performance**: Achieved zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrating:\n  - High-wall climbing onto 1.25 m obstacles (96% of robot height) in 3.63 seconds, matching human-level pace\n  - High-speed vaulting at ~3 m/s over varying obstacles\n  - Long-horizon multi-obstacle traversal (48-60 seconds) with real-time adaptation to obstacle displacement\n  - Success rates of 95-100% on 76 cm obstacles in simulation\n\n## Why It Matters\n\nThis work advances humanoid robotics by bridging the gap between controlled walking and truly agile movement. By leveraging human motion data through motion matching and augmenting imitation learning with task-driven RL, the framework enables a single robot to execute dozens of complex, dynamic skills autonomously using only onboard depth sensing. This modularity and scalability provides a practical recipe for deploying highly dynamic behaviors on real hardware—a significant step toward robots that move with human-like agility and adaptivity in complex environments.",
